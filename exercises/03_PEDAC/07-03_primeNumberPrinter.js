-- Problem --
Input: string
Output: all prime numbers present in input as substrings

- Will there always be exactly one argument?
- Will the argument always be a string?
  - If not, how to handle those cases?
- Will the argument ever be an empty string?
- What kinds of characters can the input string contain?
- Do we only have to worry about numbers in base 10?
- Presumably we are only searching for contiguous substrings.
  Can the substrings overlap? E.g. "113" => [11, 13, 113]
- Are there duplicates allowed in the result array?
- Does the result array have to be sorted or ordered in any way?
